    "\n",
    "Python's origins lie way back in distant December 1989. It was created by Guido van Rossum (the Python community's <b>Benevolent Dictator for Life </b>) as a hobby project to work on during week around Christmas. Python is famously named after the British comedy troupe Monty Python's Flying Circus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python was born out of:\n",
    "- ABC language [used by Dutch Research Institute in 1980s]\n",
    "- Amoeba distributed operating system. Van Rossum created Python as scripting language for Amoeba system. \n",

    "## Python, IPython, Jupyter\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language. Python has two basic modes:\n",
    "- script \n",
    "- interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Script mode</b> <br>\n",
    "The mode where the scripted and finished .py files are run in the Python interpreter. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Interactive mode </b> <br> \n",
    "Command line shell which gives immediate feedback for each statement, while running previously fed statements in active memory. As new lines are fed into the interpreter, the fed program is evaluated both in part and in whole. <br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>IPython + Jupyter </b> <br>\n",
    "It is impossible to stop the program for a while, maintain its state, modify something and return to the operation in the script mode. IPython (Interactive Python) has been created to solve this problem. It allows interactive work on scripts and stores objects in the memory permanently, so it is always possible to return to them. You can also run other code, stop it, and everything will be stored in memory. Jupyter on the other hand, is a graphical interface to run IPython.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## Other programming environments\n",
    "There are multiple environments to work in when it comes to Python, from simple Notepad, vim, nano, notepad++, Sublime Text, through Jupyter Notebook, to IDEs (PyCharm, Spyder etc.). Everyone is free to choose their preferred solution. During the course Jupyter Notebook is sufficient, because it is convenient, fast, has a user-friendly interface and makes making readable, structured text comments easy.\n",

    "# Installing Jupyter using Anaconda \n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution is strongly recommended. \n",
    "Anaconda Distribution includes: \n",
    "- Python, \n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook, \n",
    "- other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Anaconda\n",
    "- First, download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/. Choose Anaconda version, which is suitable for your system architecture (32/64 Bit). Downloading Anaconda’s Python 3.7 version is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, install the version of Anaconda, which you downloaded, following the instructions from the download page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Jupyter\n",
    "To run the Jupyter notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows - WinSymbol+R->type:cmd):\n",
    "- jupyter notebook <br>\n",
    "or \n",
    "- double-click the <b>start_jupyter.bat </b> file, which was delivered by instructor at the lab1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a notebook is very easy. Some important pieces of information:\n",
    "* You run a single cell using Shift+Enter (focus moves to the next cell) or Ctrl+Enter (focus stays in the same cell)\n",
    "* If you want to run all cells or e.g. all below active cell, click on Cell and appropriate Run option.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use the icons above:\n",
    "* Rectangle: stop current action\n",
    "* +: add new, empty cell below currently active cell\n",
    "* Arrows up/down: move cells\n",
    "* Scissors: cut cell; two pieces of paper: copy cell\n",
    "* Dropdown menu: choose cell type (Markdown - text, Code - Python code)\n",
    "* Kernel (notebook) is restarted using Kernel > Restart or a Refresh (circle) arrow. Restarting a notebook makes you lose all results.\n",
    "* Once in a while, a notebook is saved automatically. However in crucial moments it is good practice to save manually (Ctrl+S). You should also do this before running new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is suggested that you get used to keyboard shortcuts. If you do anything repeatedly, you should search for a keyboard shortcut and start using it. Even if at the beginning it is slower, after a while work will become much faster.\n",
    "* Ctrl+/ : comment a line\n",
    "* Shift+Del or Ctrl+D : delete current line\n",
    "* Tab : indent a line or multiple lines, Shift+Tab : remove indentation (both at the beginning of a line or if many lines have been chosen)\n",
    "* Tab : autocomplete (at the end of a line)\n",
    "* Shift+Tab : show documentation of an object (usually between parentheses: () )\n",
    "* Help > Keyboard Shortcuts : show other keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "* Some people may miss a shortcut to duplicate a line. Fortunately, there is an Open Source solution: [Line duplication](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1816)\n",
    "* If you don't like classic Notebook there, you can obviously change it: [Themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyboard shortcuts are also available in Notebook to work on cells. You can either be inside the cell (edit a cell) or work on cells. Switch between modes using keys Esc/Enter. In the cell edition mode additional shortcuts are available, e.g.:\n",
    "* A : add cell above\n",
    "* B : add cell below\n",
    "* C : copy a cell, X : cut, V : paste\n",
    "* Shift+Up : choose cells above, Shift+Down : choose cells below.\n"
